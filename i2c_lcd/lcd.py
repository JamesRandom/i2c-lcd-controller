"""
An interface to an LCD display connected via an I2C port expander, such as the
the DFRobot 20x4 display module: https://www.dfrobot.com/product-590.html.

Currently, the code has only been tested with that display module connected to a
Raspberry Pi.
"""

#
# The output pins on the PCA8574 I2C expander port are connected to the to
# control and data bits on the HD44780U LCD display controller as follows:
#
#    I2C Pin                LCD Controller Function
#      0        RS (register select: 0 for instructions, 1 for data)
#      1        R/Å´
#      2        Enable (pulse this to transfer data to/from controller)
#      3        Backlight control (1 to turn it on)
#      7:4      Data bits
#
# These pins are controlled by writing a byte to the I2C address of the port
# expander.
#
# Because only four data bits are used, the LCD controller has to be set to
# 4-bit mode before any other operations can be carried out.
