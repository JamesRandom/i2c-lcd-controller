# LCD Display Controller

This module allows a Python program to control a liquid crystal display (LCD)
module, that uses the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset.

This code assumes that the LCD is connected via an I<sup>2</sup>C interface, for example
the the [DFRobot 20x4 display module](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-590.html)
and similar products.

The code was written to be used with a Raspberry Pi but should be compatible
with other microcontrollers such as Arduino, but this has not been tested.

If you are looking for something more flexible and fully functional, then take a
look at [RPLCD](https://rplcd.readthedocs.io/). (I haven't tried this but I
probably would have used it instead of writing my own code if I had seen it
sooner.)

## Features

* Simple API
* Support for:
  * printing text at any location
  * left-to-right and right-to-left printing
  * turn display and backlight on/off
  * select cursor type
  * scroll display left/right
  * clearing display
  * clearing a single line

**To do list:**

* Use a single cursor mode setting to switch between underline, blink and no
  cursor
* Support newline characters in text (and maybe an explicit newline method)
* Cache the display contents in a framebuffer so only changes to the content
  need to be written to the display
* With that, could make the display a window onto a larger virtual screen to
  enable more efficient vertical and horizontal scrolling of text (including
  scrolling single lines)
* Add support for custom characters

## Installation

You can install from the GitHub repository. for example:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/JamesRandom/i2c-lcd-controller.git
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install from source:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JamesRandom/i2c-lcd-controller.git
$ pip install ./i2c-lcd-controller
```


## Example

```{python}
from i2c_lcd import LCD

lcd = LCD()

lcd.clear_display()
lcd.move_to(0, 5)
lcd.print("Hello world")

# Right to left text
lcd.left_to_right(False)
lcd.print_at(2, 15, "Hello world")
lcd.left_to_right(True)

# Turn off display
sleep(5)
lcd.display(False)
lcd.backlight(False)
```

## Hardware

The output pins on the PCA8574 I<sup>2</sup>C expander port are connected to the
control and data bits on the HD44780U LCD display controller as follows:

| Expander Port Pin | LCD Controller Function                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0                 | RS (register select: 0 for instructions, 1 for data)    |
| 1                 | R/WÌ…                                                     |
| 2                 | Enable (pulse this to transfer data to/from controller) |
| 3                 | Backlight control (1 to turn it on)                     |
| 7:4               | Data bits                                               |

These pins are controlled by writing a byte with the signal values to the I<sup>2</sup>C
address of the port expander.

In order to write a value to the LCD controller, two writes to the I<sup>2</sup>C interface
are required: once with the Enable bit high and then with the Enable bit low in
order to latch the data into the controller.

To write a byte to the LCD controller, two four bit values have to be written
(high-order bits first). So this requires a total of four I<sup>2</sup>C writes.
